const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Can you repair an existing LED sign board?",
    a: "Yes. SignFix can inspect LED modules, power supplies, wiring, connections, acrylic faces and related components and recommend repair, replacement or an upgrade depending on the condition.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you repair signs made by another company?",
    a: "Yes. The important factors are the current condition, construction, accessibility and repairability of the sign.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you make an old sign look new?",
    a: "In many cases, yes. Restoration may include new acrylic, LED replacement, graphics, refinishing, letter repair, cleaning and alignment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know whether I should repair or replace my sign?",
    a: "The decision depends on the structural condition, age, material, electrical system, visual condition and the cost of repeated repairs. SignFix can explain the practical options after inspection.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you manufacture new LED sign boards?",
    a: "Yes. New illuminated signage can be fabricated according to the approved artwork, size, application and site requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you make large building signs?",
    a: "Yes. Large signage requires additional planning for structure, access, installation, visibility and electrical requirements. A site assessment is recommended.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you make corporate name plates?",
    a: "Yes. Name plates can be produced to standardised corporate formats and supplied to multiple locations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you supply outside Hyderabad?",
    a: "Yes, project feasibility is assessed based on the product, quantity, destination and installation requirement. SignFix is based in Hyderabad, Telangana.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you supply internationally?",
    a: "Selected signage and name-plate products can be prepared for international shipment, subject to size, material, packaging, freight and destination requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you support retail chains?",
    a: "Yes. Centralised specifications, fabrication, replacement signage and multi-location coordination can be planned for retail networks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work with mall outlets?",
    a: "Yes. Mall projects can be planned around approved drawings, access rules, installation windows and property requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you repair a flickering sign?",
    a: "Flickering may be caused by LEDs, power supplies, wiring or connections. The sign should be diagnosed rather than replacing parts at random.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you replace only the LED modules?",
    a: "Where the sign construction allows it, LED modules can often be replaced without replacing the complete sign.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you install the signs you manufacture?",
    a: "Installation can be included according to project location and scope. For larger projects, site access and installation requirements are assessed in advance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I send for a quotation?",
    a: "Send a clear front photograph, a side photograph if possible, approximate width and height, location, business type and a short description of the requirement.",
  },
