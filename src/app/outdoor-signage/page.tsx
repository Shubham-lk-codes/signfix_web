        <p>
          Outdoor signs require materials and components appropriate to their
          location. Acrylic thickness, metal construction, protective finishes, LED
          modules, power supplies, cable routing and mounting details should all be
          considered together.

      <ContentBlock title="Outdoor repair">
        <p>
          If an outdoor sign has failed, simply changing LEDs may not solve the
          underlying problem. Water ingress, damaged seals, exposed wiring or
          deteriorated mounting components can create recurring faults. A proper
          inspection looks at the system around the failed component.
