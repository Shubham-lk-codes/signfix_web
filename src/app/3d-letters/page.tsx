          A good 3D letter is not only about its face material. Return depth, joints,
          internal LED placement, rear fixing, wiring access and final alignment all
          affect the finished appearance. On large signs, these details become even
          more important because small inconsistencies can be visible from a long
          distance.

      <ContentBlock title="Corporate, retail and hospitality applications">
        <p>
          Illuminated 3D letters are suitable for corporate entrances, reception
          areas, restaurants, cafes, retail stores, showrooms, malls and commercial
          buildings. The correct style depends on brand identity, viewing distance,
          available wall area and the desired day/night appearance.
