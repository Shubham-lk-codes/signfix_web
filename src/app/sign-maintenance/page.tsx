        <p>
          Preventive signage maintenance is especially useful for retail chains,
          restaurants, malls and corporate groups where one small signage failure can
          be repeated across locations. A scheduled inspection approach can identify
          recurring component problems and standardise replacement parts.

      <ContentBlock title="Maintenance is not just cleaning">
        <p>
          Cleaning can improve presentation, but technical maintenance goes further.
          It looks at the components that make the sign operate safely and
          consistently. SignFix can combine visual refurbishment with LED and
          electrical checks where the project requires it.
