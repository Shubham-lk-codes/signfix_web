        <p>
          A sign is only as good as the people who fabricate, wire, finish and install
          it. SignFix&apos;s in-house staff bring hands-on experience to the
          production process. The objective is to combine design understanding with
          practical fabrication and electrical knowledge so that the final sign is not
          only attractive but serviceable.

        <p>
          We maintain a workshop environment with the tools and machines required for
          key stages of signage production. This gives our team greater control over
          measurements, cutting, assembly, LED installation, wiring, finishing and
          quality checking.
