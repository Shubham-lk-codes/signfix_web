        <p>
          Restoration is ideal when the existing sign has a usable structure but has
          lost its original appearance. The frame may still be strong, the letter design
          may still be correct and the brand identity may still be relevant, but the
          face, LEDs, finish, graphics or electrical system may have deteriorated.

      <ContentBlock title="Why restoration can be better than a complete replacement">
        <p>
          A complete replacement can be appropriate, but it is not always necessary. If
          the existing sign has a good structure, restoration may reduce unnecessary
          material waste and preserve a sign format that already fits the site. At the
          same time, restoration gives the business an opportunity to upgrade LEDs,
          improve illumination and refresh the visual finish.

      <ContentBlock title="A new look without losing the brand" tone="white">
        <p>
          For corporate offices, restaurants, retail stores and showrooms, a sign
          makeover should remain faithful to the brand. The objective is not to make the
          sign look different for the sake of being different. The objective is to make
          it look intentional, current, clean and professionally executed.
