        <p>
          If you are handling signage for several locations, share the number of sites,
          city list, brand guideline, sign types, approximate quantities and required
          dates. This helps the team understand whether the requirement is a single
          repair, a rollout or a recurring support program.

      <ContentBlock title="For large signs">
        <p>
          For large building signage, include the building photograph, approximate
          facade width, proposed sign size, access information and whether illumination
          is required. If drawings or brand artwork are available, attach them.
