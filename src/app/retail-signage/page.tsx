        <p>
          A retail chain may have dozens or hundreds of locations with different
          building surfaces, landlord rules and local installation conditions. The
          challenge is to maintain the same brand appearance while adapting the sign
          to each site. SignFix can work from a master specification and produce
          site-specific dimensions and fabrication details.

      <ContentBlock title="Fast replacement of damaged signs">
        <p>
          Retail locations cannot always wait for a complete new project when a sign
          is damaged. A broken letter, cracked face or dead illumination can make an
          otherwise finished outlet look incomplete. A repair-first approach can
          sometimes restore the storefront faster than replacing the entire sign.

      <ContentBlock title="Large retail and mall projects" tone="white">
        <p>
          Retail signage may need to be coordinated with mall management, landlord
          approvals, restricted working hours, access rules and installation windows.
          SignFix can plan the fabrication and site work around those practical
          requirements.
