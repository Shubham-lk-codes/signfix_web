        <p>
          A showroom can have beautiful interiors and still look weak from outside if
          the sign is poorly illuminated or badly aligned. SignFix pays attention to
          letter edges, finish quality, illumination uniformity, mounting alignment
          and the way the sign reads from common customer approach points.

      <ContentBlock title="Showroom sign maintenance">
        <p>
          Because showroom signage is highly visible, maintenance matters. Dust,
          weather, failed LEDs and damaged acrylic can quickly reduce the visual
          quality of the frontage. Preventive inspection and prompt repairs can help
          maintain the intended appearance.
